# Computational-Musicology-_-Quantify-and-qualify-heterophony-in-Jingju-music
Quantitative analysis of pitch and rhythmic similarity between arbitrary .xml scores ; correlation analysis in the Jingju Music repertoire, as degree of heterophony between different Banshis.

## Methodology
We provide a novel method to quantitatively analyse pitch and rhythmic similarity that can be applied to a variety of musical traditions.
Second, we demonstrate a strong correlation between a number of banshis and their degree of heterophony, and argue that this plays a key role in perceptually communicating the desired emotional tonality.

## Repository structure and content
You find a folder with the Jingju music scores dataset used for the computational analysis, 2 .pdf files representing the initial Musicology Research question and the final Research paper with the analysis results, and a Python colab notebook with the computational analysis of the scores dataset.
